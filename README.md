# Target-Superstore-Data-Analysis
I created an Excel dashboard for Target Super Store's sales report spanning from 2014 to 2017. The dashboard highlights key performance indicators such as total revenue, total profit, and total units sold across three categories: furniture, office supplies, and technology. Additionally, it breaks down the profit and revenue generated by each category, showcases revenue distribution by region, and identifies states with losses.
